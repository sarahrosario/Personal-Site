# Personal-Site
This website is inspired by Sean Halpin.
I came up with this question to myself while I was building the website: 
 When creating a website with CSS, there are many different properties to choose from to style your web page. Which CSS properties to use? 

My summary:

Determine the layout and design of your website: Before you start coding your website, it's important to have a clear idea of what you want your website to look like. Think about the colors, typography, images, and overall design aesthetic you want to achieve.

Research CSS properties: Once you have an idea of what you want your website to look like, research CSS properties that can help you achieve your desired design. You can find CSS property documentation on websites such as MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, and CSS-Tricks.

Experiment with different CSS properties: As you start coding your website, try out different CSS properties to see which ones work best for your design. You can use your browser's developer tools to make changes to your CSS in real-time and see how they affect your website.

Use best practices: There are certain CSS properties that are considered best practices when it comes to web design. For example, using responsive design techniques to make sure your website looks good on all devices, and using semantic HTML to make your website more accessible to users.

Test your website: Once you have coded your website, test it on different devices and browsers to make sure it looks and functions as expected. You may need to make adjustments to your CSS to ensure your website looks good on all devices and browsers.

Remember, creating a website with CSS takes practice and experimentation. Don't be afraid to try out different CSS properties and see what works best for your design.
